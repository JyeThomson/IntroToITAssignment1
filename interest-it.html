		<p style="font-size: 20px; ">What is my interest in IT and where did it begin? I think my interest in IT began when I was fairly young, probably around nine. We used to receive burnt copies on movies on DVDs from a family member and I was very curious as to how they’d managed to get the movie onto their computer and make a copy of it. A little bit later in 2010 I began gaming and played a fair bit of Halo Reach and Call of Duty Black Ops, for better or worse this got me into IT but also got me hooked on gaming. Currently I’ve shaken off my gaming habit and work full-time in IT as an Apple authorised technician at a small chain of Apple authorised service providers (AASPs), I repair MacBooks, iMacs, iPhones and engage in sales. </p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; ">Why did I choose to study at RMIT? I chose to study at RMIT as it offers the course that I am after with the flexibility that I require. All of this as well as being a fairly well rated university. I’m keen to complete a Bachelor of IT at RMIT and dive further into the industry.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; ">What do I expect to learn during my studies? I expect to gain a much greater understanding of IT in a business environment and to understand a bit more about the IT industry. I would love to finish the degree with strong programming abilities and the potential to land a job in that area. Any skill or knowledge that I can take and apply within my current workplace would also be a great bonus.</p>
